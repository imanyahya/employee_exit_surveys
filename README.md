# Employee Exit Surveys
 
In this project, we will work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Institute in Queensland, Australia. The data can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) (the original TAFE exit data survey is no longer available).

The **GOALS** of our project are to answer these questions:
- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about the employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfation?
